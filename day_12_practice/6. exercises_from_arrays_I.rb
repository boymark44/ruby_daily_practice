#* Exercise 1: Indexing into arrays.
puts "Array Indexing: "

# Define a first_and_last method that accepts an array of strings.
# The method should concatenate the first element and the last element
# and return the result.
# Assume the list will always have 1 or more elements.

#* First and last elements:

  string_array[0].+(string_array[-1])

p first_and_last(["a", "b", "c"]) # => "ac"
p first_and_last(["bob", "tom", "rob"]) # => "bobrob"

# Define a product_of_even_indices method that accepts an
# array of numbers. The array will always have 6 total elements.
# The method should return the product (multiplied total) of
# all numbers at an even index (0, 2, 4).

#* Product of even indices:
def product_of_even_indices(integer_array)
  integer_array[0] * integer_array[2] * integer_array[4]

# Define a first_letter_of_last_string method that accepts an
# array of strings. It should return one character: the first
# letter of the last string in the array.
# Assume the array will always have at least one string.

#* First letter of last string:
def first_letter_of_last_string(string_array)
  # Using the 2D indexing:
  string_array[-1][0]
end

p first_letter_of_last_string(["cat", "dog", "zebra"]) # => "z"

#* Exercise 2: Extracting multiple array elements.
puts "\n\nExtracting Multiple Array Elements: "

# Define a split_in_two method that accepts an array.
# I'd like to split the array into two arrays.
# If the original array has an even number of elements,
# ensure that the 2 new arrays have an equal number of elements
# If the original array has an odd number of elements,
# ensure that the first new array has the greater number of elements.

# Split in two:
def split_in_two(array)

  length = array.length

  midpoint = (length / 2.0).round

  first_half = array.first(midpoint)
  second_half = array.last(length - midpoint)

  [first_half, second_half]
