# Ruby Coding Journal. (Consistency over Intensity)



## Day 1 of Coding in Ruby
- Here lies all my tears and frustrations while coding using Ruby. 
- This is your fault economy. 
- Now I am jobless. 
- Working my way to finding a good job now. 
- Hope somebody hire me. 


## Day 2 of Coding in Ruby
- Well, at least for Day 2. I did some coding. I am so fucking proud of myself. 
- Another incremental progress. Slow yet significant. 
- Added a new file called "try_ruby.rb"
- Completed 


## Day 3 of Coding in Ruby 
- Well, we should make a new template first to streamline the process. 
- Then code, code and coooooode. 
- Day 3 is done. 
- Next is the Day 4 tomorrow. So do it. Seize the moment and do not let the momentum die. 


## Day 4 of Coding in Ruby
- I finished the exercises 1 until 4.
- Currently in 5 until 8. 
- Grind your way up dude.
- Finished the 7 and 8 tonight. 


## Day 5 of Coding in Ruby
- Finished the Exercises 1 and 2. 
- Tomorrow again is another day. Hope that I can grind. 
- Help me Lord to retain all the knowledge and use them accordingly. 
- Do not allow frustrations to demoralize me. Help me to progress and improve my programming skills. 
- Finally, I finished it tonight. 


## Day 6 of Coding in Ruby 
- Start again. 
- Be consistent.
- Be familiar with the syntax and semantics.
- Figure out the complexity of logic later. 
- Never get disheartened if the way you solved the program is not complex. That is just identity crisis. Keep going. 
- So far. The Exercises 8 proves to be the most challenging so far. I want to learn it as soon as possible. Not just the memorization of writing it. I want to understand it. 
- Dammit. I messed up on Exercises 4 and 5. I forgot how the next keyword works as well as the FizzBuzz problem. I have solved this problem already.
- I am still dealing with imposter syndrome. But, I will not give up yet. I will enjoy the process myself until I am confident how to become proficient. 
- Consistency > Intensity. 
- Overall, I struggled with Exercises 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. But I will not lose hope and I promise I will solve them.
